            The embedded system is classified as a type of system that is made up of software and hardware components that is used for performing specific functions. <br> <br>
            The embedded systems can be used in various sectors like industries, agricultural devices, medical devices and automobiles industry, and many more sectors. <br> <br>
            The embedded system can be used to perform a single task or more than one task at the same time. <br> <br>
            There are multiple components involved in the design of an embedded system. <br> <br>
            The components used are software components and hardware components

            As the embedded system is made up of hardware and software components.
            In below section hardware components are described below:

            <h3>1. Power supply</h3> 
            For the embedded system the power supply is the key component to provide the power to the embedded system circuit. 
            Usually, the embedded system requires 5 V supply or can be range from 1.8 to 3.3. V.  The power supply source can be battery or can be provided by a wall adaptor.
            The power supply is selected as per user requirements and application requirements.
            The power supply should be smooth and should be efficient so that continuous power supply can be provided to an embedded system.
            The power supply should also allow dissipation and should be as efficient as possible.

            <h3>2. Processor</h3>
            For any embedded system the processor acts as the brain of the system.
            The processor is responsible for deciding the performance of the embedded system.
            In the market there are multiple types of processors available and can be selected as per user requirement.
            The embedded system can act as a microcontroller and microprocessor.
            The processor can be an 8-bit processor, a 16-bit processor, and a 32-bit processor.
            The lesser the bit the smaller the application is for embedded systems.
            When large applications are used the higher bit processor is needed in the embedded system.
            The processor needs to be very fast, the price should be minimum, performance should be good so that functions can be performed very fast in an embedded system.
            
            <h3>3. Memory</h3>
            As there are different microcontrollers is used in the embedded system the memory is present in the microcontroller itself.  There are basically two types of memory RAM(Random access memory) and ROM (Read-only memory). As the RAM is volatile type memory the data can be stored temporarily in the memory and when system is switch off the data is lost from the memory. Read-only memory is classified as code memory. The ROM is used for storing the program and when the system is switch on the embedded system fetch code from ROM memory.
            
            <h3>4. Timers counters</h3>
            In some of the applications there is always a requirement of delay that needed to provide in the application. For example, in LED display applications there is a requirement of some delay so that LED can be continuing blink.  And for that timer and counter can be used in the embedded system. The programming can be done in such a way so that delay can be generating the embedded system.  The delay time span can be decided by using the crystal oscillator and system frequency so that delay can be generated as per user requirement.
            
            <h3>5. Communication ports</h3>
            The communication port is the type of interface that is used to communicate with other types of embedded systems. In the embedded system there is multiple types of communication ports like UART, USB, Ethernet, RS-485, and many more. When an embedded system is used in small scale application then the communication ports can be used from the microcontroller. There are also serial protocols that can be used for sending data from one system board to another board.
