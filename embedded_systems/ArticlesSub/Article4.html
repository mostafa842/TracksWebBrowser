        <div class="article">
            The world we live in is becoming increasingly connected, thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). <br>
            It's a phenomenon that's shaping industries, homes, and our daily lives. At the heart of this revolution is the symbiotic relationship between IoT and embedded systems. <br> <br>
            In this article, we'll unravel the synergy between these two technological powerhouses and how they're driving innovation and connectivity.

        <div class="article">
            The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the interconnectedness of physical objects, devices, and systems through the internet.
            These “smart” entities collect and exchange data, making them capable of real-time monitoring, control, and automation.

            <h2>Role of Embedded systems in the Internet of Things</h2>

        <div class="article">
            Internet of Things is the most trending technology in this modern world as we can control the embedded devices from any location using the Internet of things.
            In sum, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a process in which objects are equipped with sensors, actuators, and processors that involve hardware board design and development, software systems, web APIs, and protocols,
             which together create a connected environment of embedded systems. <br> 
             
            The connected environment allows technologies to connect multiple devices, platforms, and networks. 
            Thus, it creates a web of communication that changes the way we interact digitally with the world.
            These connected embedded systems can change our demeanour with our environment, communities, and homes. <br> 
            Hence, when it comes to designing embedded IoT systems, We need to design it for specific functions, keeping in account factors like low power consumption, secured architecture, reliable processor, etc.
            However, designing an embedded IoT hardware system is challenging. There are several challenges designers face in designing a hardware system for embedded IoT devices which include:
            <h4>1: Lack of necessary flexibility for running applications over embedded systems.</h4> 
             For instance, the issues while ensuring smooth integration of new services, difficulty in adapting to new environments, frequent changes in hardware and software facilities,
             packaging and integration of small size chip with low weight and lesser power consumption, carrying out energy awareness operations, etc.
            
            <h4>2:The security crisis in embedded system design.</h4>
            <h4>3:High power dissipation of embedded system design.</h4>
            <h4>4:Problems of testing the design.</h4>
            <h4>5:Also, Inadequate functional safety of safety-critical embedded systems.</h4>
            <h4>6:Finally, Increased cost and time-to-market.</h4>
