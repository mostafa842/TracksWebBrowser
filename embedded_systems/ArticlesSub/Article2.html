            An embedded system is a computer system that executes tasks in a unique electrical mechanical system. <br> <br>
            It comprises a computer's CPU, memory, and the usual input/output devices. <br> <br>
            It's usually found as part of a bigger device that has both electrical/electronic technologies & mechanical components. <br><br>
            The requisite real-time computing is a constraint for embedded systems since they govern actual machine functioning of where they are found. <br> <br>
            Embedded systems are used to control a variety of current gadgets. In 2009, it was estimated that 98% of all microprocessors produced will be utilized in embedded systems. <br> <br>

            The Apollo Guidance Computer which was the 1st contemporary real-time embedded computer system was built for the Apollo Program in the 1960s by Dr. Charles Stark Draper of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
            For the Apollo-Command and Lunar Module, the Apollo Guidance Computer was intended to gather data mechanically and conduct critical computations.
            The Intel-4004 was the first widely accessible CPU device that uses externally used memory & auxiliary chips were brought to use by Intel (1971). <br> <br>
            Thanks to a guideline published by the National Engineering Manufacturers Association (NEMA) (1978), input, memory, and output components are combined into one chip as the CPU by the 80s,
            culminating in the building of a microcontroller. <br> <br>
            
            The microcontroller-based embedded systems would eventually make their way into every facet of customers' daily lives, from smart cards and cell phones to traffic lights and thermometers.

            Embedded systems are always portions or components of a more complex device, as the term "embedded" implies.
            They're smaller CPUs that can be incorporated into other electrical mechanical systems for cost reduction and low-power consumption.
            CPU, memory storage, power supply, and communication ports are all common components. <br>
            Embedded systems use communication ports for transferring data between the CPU and external devices, which are usually other embedded systems, using the communication protocol.
            The CPU evaluates this data using the barest minimum of software saved up in its memory.
            The software is usually meticulously tuned to the system's functionality. <br> <br>

            The processor might be a microprocessor/microcontroller. Microcontrollers are essentially microprocessors with built-in features and memory.
            Microprocessors use distinct electrical components instead of including memory and peripherals on the chip.
            These can be used, however, because microprocessors are less integrated than microcontrollers. <br>
            System on a Chip (SoC) is a term that is widely used to combine many CPUs and interfaces on a single chip.
            They're commonly used in higher-level embedded systems. <br> <br>
            Embedded systems are frequently utilized in actual operating/functioning settings and interface with the hardware via a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The near real-time technique is appropriate at greater tiers of chip capacity, as specified by engineers who progressively determined that systems are typically efficient and that the activities are tolerable to minor changes in action time. In such a scenario, stripped-down versions of the Linux operating system are typically used. However, other systems, such as Embedded Java and Windows IoT, have been optimized to operate on these systems.
